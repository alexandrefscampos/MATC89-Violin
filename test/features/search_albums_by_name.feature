Feature: Buscar √Ålbuns por Nome
  As a user
  I want to search for albums by name
  So that I can quickly find albums I want to mark as listened or review

  Scenario: Successfully searching for an album by name
    Given I am logged into the application as "Reynan Paiva" 
    When I enter the name "Thriller" into the search bar
    And I submit the search 
    Then I should see a list of albums matching the name "Thriller" 
    And each album in the results should display its cover art and name
